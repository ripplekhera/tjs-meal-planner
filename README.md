# Harvest

**A Trader Joe's–first meal planner that solves the question "What's for dinner?"**

My wife and I shop at Trader Joe's every week. I used to do the shopping and I'd reach for my favorites like steak, spaghetti bolognese, burgers, nachos, with an occasional healthier option like salmon thrown in. On top of that, we go out to eat fairly often, so we weren't eating healthy enough. We also got bored of everything we made — pizzas, curries, fried rice — we'd cycle through phases of eating something, getting sick of it, and going out a lot instead. I wanted to meet my wife's need for an ever-changing variety of healthy, home-cooked meals from ingredients at Trader Joe's.

With that in mind, I figured I'd use Claude or similar to meal plan for us, but I quickly realized I wanted a scaffold around it. I thought about just building skills, but realized Cursor could build the frontend in like an hour. Once I had it built, customizing it for our exact preferences and our Trader Joe's layout was easy. After a couple rounds of shopping to work out the kinks, my wife now does the shopping and I make dinner. I can honestly say this app has done more to reduce stress in my marriage than anything else we've tried. We always know there's a healthy, easy dinner option in the fridge.

We've tried a ton of configurations, but what we settled on is 1 breakfast, 1 lunch, and 2 dinners, plus a section for household items and a section for junk food. Every week I launch an agent (I'm sure you could automate this) that reads the Fearless Flyer, builds a meal plan that meets our dietary restrictions and protein/fiber needs, and puts it in a shopping list ordered to match our store's layout. The main pitfalls: forcing a rigid schedule, and planning too many meals. Each breakfast/lunch gets 3-5 servings, plus 2 dinners plus leftovers — that's plenty for a week. The only other thing to mention is that there are no recipes, just ingredients for a meal. I'm a good cooks so this is plenty for me. I'll grill, fry bake and broil based on what I want that day. But now whatever I make is meeting all of our health and dietary needs every time I cook.

A year ago I could never have built anything like this. Now my marriage is a little lighter, because dinner stopped being one more thing we had to figure out every day.

## Why Harvest

Most meal apps optimize for recipes. Harvest optimizes for **one weekly shop at Trader Joe's**:

- A flat menu of breakfasts, lunches and dinners (no day grid to babysit). The count of each is one setting, `EXPECTED_MEAL_COUNTS` in `lib/constants.ts` (currently 5 / 3 / 7).
- Macros that matter in practice — **calories, protein, carbs, fat, and fiber**
- A shopping list ordered for how you actually walk the store
- A companion “junk” list and household goods list beside the meals
- Hearts, swaps, and an explore library so good meals come back

It also ships with markdown + JSON tooling so you (or an AI assistant) can draft a week, validate it, and publish it into the live app.

## What you get

| Surface | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Menu** (`/menu`) | The week’s meals by type, plus Junk and Household tabs |
| **Shop** (`/shop`) | Derived shopping list in store walking order |
| **Explore** (`/explore`) | Searchable meal library with hearts and history |
| **Offline-friendly** | Service worker keeps the current week usable in-store |

Under the hood: Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Docker.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker Engine + Compose)
- Node.js 20+ (only needed for host-side scripts and local `npm` workflows)

## Quick start

The happy path: one Compose file, one browser tab.

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/harvest.git
cd harvest
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set a real `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, plus `AUTH_USERS` and `AUTH_SECRET` (see [Login](#login)). The production Compose file refuses to start without all three.

### 2. Start the app

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** — it redirects to `/login`. Sign in with one of the `AUTH_USERS` accounts and you land on `/menu`.

Postgres stays on the Docker network (not exposed on the host). The app listens on port `3000`.

### 3. Load the sample week

With the stack up and signed in, click **Seed plan** on the empty Menu. It loads the `data/current-week.json` that was baked into the image at build time.

Every API route requires a session, so seeding from the command line means signing in first and reusing the cookie:

```bash
curl -c .cookies -d "username=alice" --data-urlencode "password=YOUR_PASSWORD" http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login
curl -b .cookies -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/mealplan/seed
rm .cookies
```

You should see a full Menu with meals, macros, and shopping data.

### Stop / reset

```bash
docker compose down          # stop containers
docker compose down -v       # also wipe the Postgres volume
```

## Development stack (hot reload)

For day-to-day UI work, use the dev Compose file. It mounts the repo, runs `next dev`, and publishes Postgres on `localhost:5432` so host scripts can talk to the DB.

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # DATABASE_URL already points at localhost
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run seed:meal-plan    # host → localhost:5432
npm run lint
npm run test:meal-plan-tools
```

The dev Compose file doesn't pass `AUTH_USERS` to the app container, so login is off on the dev stack and `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/mealplan/seed` works without signing in. Host scripts (`seed:meal-plan`, `meal-plan:publish`) write to Postgres directly and never go through login.

## Login

Harvest has a simple login for a fixed set of household users. Set two environment variables (in `.env`, or in your host's settings such as Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables):

```
AUTH_USERS=alice:first-password,bob:second-password   # username:password pairs, comma-separated
AUTH_SECRET=<32+ random characters>                    # openssl rand -base64 32
```

- Usernames are case-insensitive; passwords can't contain commas.
- Sessions last 30 days in a signed, HTTP-only cookie. Sign out from the button in the header.
- Remove someone from `AUTH_USERS` to revoke their access; change `AUTH_SECRET` to sign everyone out.
- Production builds refuse to serve pages until both variables are set. `npm run dev` skips login unless `AUTH_USERS` is set.

## Using the app

1. **Menu** — browse Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner; heart, swap, or remove meals; add from the library.
2. **Junk / Household tabs** — manage the companion snack list and household staples for the week.
3. **Shop** — check items off while you walk the store (works better after a visit so the service worker can cache the week).
4. **Explore** — find past meals by type, protein, or search; open a meal for full ingredient + macro detail.

## Generating a week with Claude

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (in `.env`, or your host's environment), then tap **Generate** next to "The Menu". Pick this week or next week, add anything to avoid or notes for the whole week or per meal type ("all vegetarian" applies to every meal of that type; "2 vegetarian" in the notes is a preference), and generate. It usually takes 2–4 minutes and saves the week straight to the database.

- Breakfasts, lunches, dinners and the junk list are generated as parallel Claude calls, then the app checks the whole week: meal counts, your hard rules, no meal from the last few weeks, and each base or engine in at most 2 meals (`MAX_BUILD_VALUE_USES_PER_WEEK`). Meal types that fail get one corrected try. A week that still fails isn't saved.
- **Skip shellfish this week** and **Skip bell peppers this week** are one-tap toggles. Each covers the whole family of words (shrimp, crab, clams, oyster sauce and the rest; bell, sweet and roasted red peppers) across every meal and the junk list, and a week that breaks one isn't saved. The word lists are `SKIP_GROUPS` in `lib/generation/rules.ts`.
- How many of each meal to plan is `EXPECTED_MEAL_COUNTS` in `lib/constants.ts`; the prompts, checks and form all follow it.
- The prompts are in `lib/generation/generate.ts`; the guides sent with them are listed in `lib/generation/context.ts`.
- `npm run meal-plan:generate-draft -- [YYYY-MM-DD] [--rules rules.json]` does the same from the command line and writes a draft to `data/mealplans/` instead of the database.

## Authoring a week

Harvest treats a week as a markdown file with a fenced JSON block (see `data/current-week.md` and `data/mealplans/`).

```bash
# Optional: refresh markdown from the current JSON seed
npm run meal-plan:bootstrap-markdown

# Edit data/current-week.md (keep the JSON fence valid)

npm run meal-plan:sync      # validate + write data/current-week.json
npm run meal-plan:publish   # upsert into Postgres (dev stack / reachable DB)
```

`meal-plan:publish` connects to `DATABASE_URL` from your machine, so it only works when Postgres is reachable, as on the dev stack. The production Compose file keeps Postgres off the host, so to publish a new week there:

```bash
npm run meal-plan:sync            # writes data/current-week.json
docker compose up -d --build      # bakes the new JSON into the image
```

Then run the signed-in `curl` from [Quick start](#3-load-the-sample-week). (The **Seed plan** button only appears while the database has no week at all, so it won't show once one exists.) Seeding upserts by `weekRange`, so re-seeding the same week replaces its meals and keeps checked-off shopping items.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run seed:meal-plan` | Upsert `data/current-week.json` into Postgres |
| `npm run meal-plan:sync` | Validate markdown → rewrite JSON |
| `npm run meal-plan:publish` | Publish the synced week to the database |
| `npm run meal-plan:bootstrap-markdown` | Rebuild `current-week.md` from JSON |
| `npm run meal-plan` | CLI wrapper (`new` / `validate` / `publish`; scaffolds from `data/meal-plan-skill.md`) |
| `npm run meal-plan:generate-draft` | Generate a week with Claude into `data/mealplans/` (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply `db/init/*.sql` to `DATABASE_URL` (safe to re-run) |
| `npm run test:shopping` | Shopping-list order unit checks |
| `npm run test:meal-plans` | Meal-plan fixture validation |
| `npm run test:generation` | Plan-generation checks (offline, no Claude calls) |
| `npm run test:meal-plan-tools` | Run all three test suites |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |

Host-side DB scripts expect `DATABASE_URL` (see `.env.example`). Use the **dev** Compose file, or point `DATABASE_URL` at a reachable Postgres.

## API overview

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/mealplan` | Latest or selected week (+ available weeks) |
| `POST` | `/api/mealplan/seed` | Seed from `data/current-week.json` |
| `POST` | `/api/mealplan/generate` | Generate and save a week with Claude (`{ weekStart?, rules?, replace? }`) |
| `PATCH` | `/api/mealplan/meals` | Swap / add / remove menu slots |
| `POST` | `/api/mealplan/ratings` | Heart a meal |
| `*` | `/api/mealplan/shopping` | Shopping list updates |
| `*` | `/api/mealplan/junk` | Junk list updates |
| `*` | `/api/mealplan/household-goods` | Household list updates |
| `GET`/`POST` | `/api/meals` | Meal library |
| `PUT` | `/api/meals/[id]` | Update a meal |

**Security:** every page and API route requires a signed-in user (see [Login](#login)). The only public routes are `/login` and `/api/auth/*`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely fix |
|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `AUTH_USERS` or `AUTH_SECRET` error on `docker compose up` | Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and set all three |
| Every page says "Login is not configured" | `AUTH_SECRET` is shorter than 32 characters, or `AUTH_USERS` has no valid `user:password` pair |
| App is up but Menu is empty | Sign in and click **Seed plan**, or use the signed-in `curl` from [Quick start](#3-load-the-sample-week) |
| `curl` to `/api/...` returns `{"error":"Not signed in"}` | Sign in with `curl -c` first and pass the cookie with `-b` (see [Quick start](#3-load-the-sample-week)) |
| `npm run seed:meal-plan` can’t connect | Use `docker-compose.dev.yml` (Postgres on `5432`) or fix `DATABASE_URL` |
| Stale UI after a rebuild | Hard-refresh; if needed `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build` |
| Port 3000 already in use | Stop the other process, or change the host mapping in Compose |
