## 🧍 User Profiles

### Household (meals)
- **Source of truth:** `data/diner-preferences.md` — read fully at the start of every planning session. Where this file disagrees with it, it wins.
- A family of 4: Dad (84; shellfish allergy, diabetes, gout; likes Indian and Asian flavors), an 11-year-old daughter (not spicy, doesn't like bell peppers, loves shellfish), and a couple who like spice and want slightly lower carb. Plan every meal for 4 servings unless it's marked for one person.
- **Shellfish and bell peppers:** keep them separable — shellfish only as a separately cooked add-on, with a separate protein for Dad, or in a meal marked "(not for Dad)" — Dad's serving never contains it; bell peppers on the side or easy to pick out.
- **Spice:** cook shared meals mild; put heat in a separate at-the-table component in ≥3 dinners.
- **Calories:** one adult serving loosely **450–550 kcal**; keep the base separable so the couple can go lower carb.
- **Cooking:** 20–30 minutes, up to two pans; up to 2 longer dinners a week. Frozen grains/veg freely; fully frozen or packaged entrées (including TJ's Indian dishes) **≤4/week, ≤3 of them dinners**.
- **Proteins:** rotate roster in doc. **≥3 types/week.** Red meat in ≤2 dinners. **Hard no: pineapple.**
- **Cuisine:** Indian and Asian favorites; at least 5 profiles each week, any one cuisine in at most 3 meals and at most 2 dinners.
- **Breakfasts:** at least 2 savory, at most 2 sweet, at most 2 oat-heavy per week.
- **Lunches:** assemble only — no cooking; homemade salads over kits.
- **Fiber:** first-class on every card; legumes, whole grains, veg, seeds.
- **Engines:** widely vary TJ's sauces, dressings and seasonings — check [traderjoes.com](https://www.traderjoes.com) and the Fearless Flyer for new options; **each engine in at most 2 meals per week.**
- **Avoids:** spicy base dishes, shellfish or bell peppers mixed into a shared base, too many salad kits, bland proteins, repetitive weeks, product-catalogue meals, pineapple.

### Companion (Secondary User — Junk List Only)
- **Source of truth:** `data/companion-preferences.md`
- Gets a **separate weekly junk list** — make good calls without asking clarifying questions.
- **Full rules:** `data/companion-preferences.md` (flyer-first, dislikes, per-category counts, product pools).
- **Categories (exact order):** Coffee/Creamer → Beer/Wine → Chips → Sweets → Frozen Food → Frozen Treats → Beverages/Drinks

## 🏪 Trader Joe's Mastery — Core Operating Principle

**The goal is real food built with TJ's help — not a product catalogue assembled into a bowl.**

TJ's is the shopping destination, not the identity of every ingredient. The meal plan should read like a person cooking with great pantry ingredients — not like a TJ's marketing deck.

### When to Use TJ's Brand Names

| Use TJ's branding | Use generic names |
|---|---|
| Signature engines & sauces (Chili Onion Crunch, Soyaki, Bomba, Zhoug, EBTB Seasoning, Green Goddess Dressing, etc.) | Basic proteins: "chicken breasts," "salmon fillet," "ground turkey," "shrimp," "eggs" |
| Specialty or unique items the shopper goes to TJ's specifically for (Elote Chopped Salad Kit, Norwegian Crispbread, Cauliflower Gnocchi, Frozen Gingery Green Beans with Shiitake, etc.) | Fresh produce: "avocado," "zucchini," "cucumber," "cherry tomatoes," "baby spinach," "banana" |
| Branded dairy where the specific product matters (Non-Fat Plain Greek Yogurt, Low-Fat Cottage Cheese) | Commodity starches used as basic ingredients: "brown rice," "rolled oats," "lentils," "quinoa," "chickpeas" |
| Items that would be confusing or inferior if substituted (Mandarin Orange Chicken, Beef Bulgogi, Palak Paneer) | Basic breads and wraps: "sprouted bread," "lavash," "pita" |

### Frozen Item Rule

| Frozen type | Usage guidance |
|---|---|
| Frozen grains (brown rice pouches, jasmine rice, ancient grains blend) | ✅ Use freely — great time-saver, no compromise |
| Frozen vegetables (broccoli, edamame, peas, riced cauliflower, gingery green beans) | ✅ Use freely — quality is often better than fresh |
| Fully frozen ready-to-eat entrées (Palak Paneer, Butter Chicken, Beef Bulgogi, Orange Chicken) | ⚠️ Max 4 per week (with other packaged entrées), at most 3 of them dinners — always pair with at least one fresh or cooked component |

### Search the Web When Uncertain
TJ's discontinues items and adds seasonal ones regularly. If you're unsure a product still exists or has been renamed, search the web before including it. When uncertain, swap to a verified current product rather than guessing.

## 🛒 TRADER JOE'S INGREDIENT CATALOG

This catalog is organized **ingredient-first** — start with what you're building around (a protein, a base, a vegetable) and find the best TJ's option for it. Every item listed has been verified as a real TJ's product.

## 📐 Macro Science

### Per-meal guidance (`data/diner-preferences.md`)
The week is a flat list of meals — **no daily calorie/protein targets**. All meals target **450–550 kcal** loosely. **Fiber is first-class** on every ingredient and meal card.

```
cal: 450–550 (all meal types)
protein: aim high — no hard floor, but prioritize
fiber: required on every card; higher is better
carbs/fat: no specific targets
```

Full rules, household health guidance, and the week validation checklist are in `data/diner-preferences.md`. Do not duplicate them here.

### Macro Calculation Rules
- **Every `macros` object includes `fiber`** (per ingredient AND per meal). The meal's fiber equals the sum of its ingredients' fiber.
- **Always calculate from real portion sizes** — 3oz of Just Chicken ≈ 21g protein; 5oz ≈ 35g; a 6oz salmon fillet ≈ 34g protein
- **Never round aggressively** — 23g protein is not "about 25g"
- **Lean into fiber** — choose legumes, whole grains, and vegetables when you can; it is the headline nutrient on every meal card
- **Fully frozen complete entrées** (Butter Chicken with Basmati, etc.) already include a starch — do not add a separate base or you will double-count carbs and calories

---

## 🗓️ Meal Plan Structure

### Week Format
- A flat list of breakfasts, lunches and dinners — no days, no timeslots, no snack slot. The count of each is set in the app (`EXPECTED_MEAL_COUNTS` in `lib/constants.ts`) and stated in each planning request.
- The app's "The Menu" view groups the meals by type.

### Meal Variety Rules
Follow `data/diner-preferences.md` for the full validation checklist. Key rules:
- **Protein rotation**: ≥3 different protein types across the week
- **Vegetarian**: welcome when it fits the week; make protein-complete builds when included
- **No repeat meals** within the same week; skip meals served in the last ~7 days (`last_served_at`)
- **Each engine and each base in at most 2 meals per week** (and none repeated within a single meal)
- **Cuisine rotation**: at least 5 profiles per week; any one cuisine in at most 3 meals and at most 2 dinners
- **Breakfast variety**: at least 2 savory, at most 2 sweet, at most 2 oat-heavy
- **Shellfish**: shellfish only as a separately cooked add-on, with a separate protein for Dad, or in a meal marked "(not for Dad)" — Dad's serving never contains it
- **Bell peppers**: separable for the daughter (on the side or easy to pick out)
- **Spice**: shared meals cooked mild; heat at the table
- **Hard no**: pineapple
- **High heart_count** meals should anchor each week; **high appearance_count** meals rotated out periodically

### Meal Build Format

Every meal has **4 pillars**, and each pillar can contain **1–3 items** (as a string or an array of strings). This is how you get **4–7 build pills total**, with most meals landing at **4–5**.

- **pro**: The protein. Use a generic ingredient name when it's a grocery staple ("salmon fillet, pan-seared," "chicken breasts, sliced," "ground turkey, browned"). Use a TJ's product name when the product is the point ("Trader Joe's Just Chicken," "Trader Joe's Smoked Salmon," "Trader Joe's Hardwood Smoked Pulled Chicken"). Always include a brief prep note — cooking method or how it's used.
- **base**: The carb/grain/starch. Generic for commodities ("brown rice," "quinoa," "rolled oats"). TJ's brand for specialty items ("Trader Joe's Cauliflower Gnocchi," "Trader Joe's Norwegian Crispbread," "Trader Joe's Frozen Harvest Grains Blend").
- **veg**: The vegetable. Generic names default ("zucchini, sautéed," "baby spinach," "Persian cucumbers"). TJ's prefix only for specific formats ("Trader Joe's Cruciferous Crunch Collection," "Trader Joe's Frozen Gingery Green Beans with Shiitake").
- **engine**: The flavor anchor. **Always a named TJ's sauce, seasoning, dressing, or salad kit — full brand name, no exceptions.** This is where the TJ's identity lives.

#### Build pill count guidance
- **Target 4–7 total build pills** per meal.
- **Most meals should be 4 or 5 pills**.
- When going from 4 → 5 pills, prefer:
  - adding a **2nd veg** (crunch/produce/side veg), or
  - adding a **base grain as a 2nd base item**.
- Add a **2nd engine** only when it’s truly part of the flavor stack (e.g., sauce + seasoning).

### Ingredient Count Guidance
- Meals may use **4–7 ingredients**; most land at **4–5**.
- Use **6–7** only when it adds real variety without turning the build into a product catalog.

Meals should fit the household's **20–30 minute, up-to-two-pans** weeknight window (up to 2 longer dinners a week). Some involve actual cooking (searing, sautéing, roasting); some are assembly. A good week has a mix of both.

## 🛒 Shopping List — Home Trader Joe's Walk Order

### Shopping List Rules
- **Do not author `shoppingList` by hand**: the app derives it from meal `ingredients`.
- **Make ingredient names shopping-ready**: each `ingredients[].name` should be the item a shopper can recognize at Trader Joe's.
- **Be quantity specific per meal**: keep amounts in `ingredients[].quantity` for meal-card display, not weekly shopping totals.
- **Include every buyable component as an ingredient**: anything needed for a meal should appear in that meal's `ingredients`.
- **Pantry state is app-managed**: pantry flags live on the persisted shopping list after user interaction.
- **Frozen wins over fresh naming**: frozen broccoli, salmon, edamame, and grains belong in Frozen Food, not vegetables, meats, vegan, or pantry.
- **Vegan Items is not a global vegan override**: beans, lentils, chickpeas, frozen edamame, and frozen vegan entrees stay in their normal physical sections.

## 🍺 Companion junk List

**Source of truth:** `data/companion-preferences.md` — read it fully before building `junkList`. Do not duplicate category rules here; the doc covers dislikes, counts, flyer-first picks, and product pools.

Summary for quick orientation only:

- **Approach:** Fearless Flyer first; soft rotation week to week.
- **Categories (exact order):** Coffee/Creamer → Beer/Wine → Chips → Sweets → Frozen Food → Frozen Treats → Beverages/Drinks
- **Key constraints:** see Dislikes and Quick Reference in `data/companion-preferences.md`.

## 🗄️ Database Query Strategy

### Step 1 — Pull Meal Library
```sql
SELECT 
  id, name, meal_type, protein, base, veg, engine,
  calories, protein_grams, carbs_grams, fat_grams,
  heart_count, appearance_count, last_served_at
FROM meals
ORDER BY heart_count DESC, appearance_count ASC
LIMIT 300
```

### Step 2 — Filter Recent Meals
Exclude any meal where `last_served_at` is within the past 7 days.

### Step 3 — Segment by Meal Type
Split into: Breakfast candidates / Lunch candidates / Dinner candidates / Snack candidates

### Step 4 — Select Using Priority Rules
1. **High heart_count + not recently served** → Use first; these are proven winners
2. **High heart_count + high appearance_count** → Use sparingly; risk of staleness
3. **Low appearance_count + solid macros** → Good candidates to reintroduce
4. **appearance_count = 0** → Use 1–2 per week max as "new try" slots

### Meal Feedback Check
```sql
SELECT meal_id, liked, feedback_text 
FROM meal_feedback 
WHERE liked = FALSE 
ORDER BY updated_at DESC 
LIMIT 50
```
Never serve a disliked meal unless feedback is >60 days old and the reason no longer applies.

## ✅ Full Generation Pipeline

### Step 1: Research
- Query database for full meal library
- Filter last 7 days
- Segment by type and protein
- Note top 5 favorites by heart_count per type

### Step 2: Week Architecture
Read `data/diner-preferences.md` first, then:
- Choose a protein arc with ≥3 types
- Spread cuisine profiles — at least 5 per week; any one in at most 3 meals and at most 2 dinners
- Ensure breakfast variety (at least 2 savory, at most 2 sweet, at most 2 oat-heavy)
- Vary engines and bases (each in at most 2 meals across the week)
- Plan 20–30 min cooks (up to 2 longer dinners); no more than 4 fully frozen or packaged entrées, at most 3 of them dinners
- Include an Indian night, 1–2 soup nights, and 1–2 family favorites; cook shared meals mild with heat at the table

### Step 3: Build Each Meal
1. Assign meals from candidate lists (breakfast, lunch and dinner counts per `EXPECTED_MEAL_COUNTS`)
2. Calculate each meal's macros from ingredient portions — **including fiber**
3. Target **450–550 kcal** loosely; favor fiber-rich builds
4. Confirm the meal's `macros.fiber` equals the sum of ingredient fiber
5. Prefer chicken thighs over breast when either works; never use pineapple

### Step 4: Ingredient Completeness
1. Walk through every meal and ensure `ingredients` contains every buyable component
2. Use consistent item names so the derived list deduplicates correctly
3. Keep quantities per meal in `ingredients[].quantity`
4. Do not calculate weekly shopping totals
5. Add universal staples only when they are actually used by meals

### Step 5: Junk List
Follow `data/companion-preferences.md` end to end (dislikes, per-category counts, flyer-first picks, product pools). Glance at last week's junk list — avoid repeating the exact same products when practical.

### Step 6: Validate
Use the checklist in `data/diner-preferences.md`, plus:
- ✅ Breakfast, lunch and dinner counts match `EXPECTED_MEAL_COUNTS`
- ✅ Every meal and ingredient carries a `fiber` macro (grams)
- ✅ All meals loosely 450–550 kcal
- ✅ ≥3 protein types; no pineapple
- ✅ Each engine and each base in at most 2 meals
- ✅ Dad's serving never contains shellfish; bell peppers separable
- ✅ No more than 4 fully frozen or packaged entrées, at most 3 of them dinners
- ✅ All items are real TJ's products (web search to verify uncertain items)
- ✅ Meal ingredients complete; derived shopping list in store walk order
- ✅ JSON matches WeekData schema; all numbers are numbers, not strings
- ✅ the companion junk list follows `data/companion-preferences.md`

## 📦 Data Schema (WeekData)

```ts
interface Macros {
  cal: number,
  p: number,                  // grams
  c: number,                  // grams
  f: number,                  // grams
  fiber: number               // grams — first-class macro, on every meal & ingredient
}

interface WeekData {
  weekRange: string,          // "Apr 28 – May 2"
  // A FLAT list of meals; counts per type come from EXPECTED_MEAL_COUNTS. No days, no timeslots.
  meals: Array<{
    type: "Breakfast" | "Lunch" | "Dinner" | "Snack",
    name: string,
    build: {
      // Each pillar can be a string or an array of strings to support 4–7 build pills.
      // Most meals should end up with 4–5 total pills across all pillars.
      pro: string | string[],     // protein with prep note — generic name or TJ's brand per catalog rules
      base: string | string[],    // base item — generic or TJ's brand per catalog rules
      veg: string | string[],     // vegetable — generic name default
      engine: string | string[]   // always full TJ's brand name, no exceptions
    },
    ingredients?: Array<{         // each ingredient also carries full macros incl. fiber
      name: string,
      quantity: string,
      category: "pro" | "base" | "veg" | "engine",
      macros: Macros
    }>,
    macros: Macros
  }>,
  shoppingList?: Array<{      // optional; derived from meal ingredients by the app
    category: string,
    items: Array<{
      n: string,
      q?: string,
      pantry?: boolean
    }>
  }>,
  junkList: Array<{
    category: string,         // "Coffee/Creamer", "Beer/Wine", "Chips", "Sweets", "Frozen Food", "Frozen Treats", "Beverages/Drinks"
    items: Array<{
      n: string,
      q: string
    }>
  }>
}
```

## 🚀 Publishing Pipeline

1. Open `data/current-week.md`
2. Replace the entire content inside the fenced ` ```json ` block with your validated WeekData object
3. Run sync:
   ```bash
   npm run meal-plan:sync
   ```
4. If sync succeeds clean:
   ```bash
   npm run meal-plan:publish
   ```

Publishing upserts the week into PostgreSQL, updates all meal library stats, recalculates appearance counts and heart ratings, and makes the week live.

## 🔧 Bootstrap Commands

```bash
npm run meal-plan:bootstrap-markdown   # Rebuild markdown from current JSON
npm run seed:meal-plan                 # Seed database from JSON (recovery only)
```

## 📋 Source of Truth Hierarchy

1. **Live PostgreSQL database** — runtime source of truth
2. **`data/current-week.md`** — AI working file; only the fenced JSON block is parsed
3. **`data/current-week.json`** — machine-readable artifact; written by sync script

## 🧠 Tone & Naming

Meal names should sound like something you'd order at a good fast-casual spot — or cook on a Tuesday because you actually feel like it. Not "Protein Bowl Option A." Not "TJ's Product + TJ's Product Bowl."

**Target style:**
- "Crunchy Salmon Bowl"
- "Zhoug Herb Chicken"
- "Pesto Salmon Pasta"
- "Everything Bagel Smash"
- "Soyaki Chicken Stir Fry"
- "Chili Crunch Salmon with Cauliflower Rice"
- "Bomba Chicken & Farro Plate"
- "Lentil Feta Power Bowl"
- "Green Goddess Egg Bowl"
- "Elote Chopped Salad with Chicken"

When seen by a real person, the plan should make them think: *"I actually want to make this tonight."*

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Over-branding basics** — "eggs" in a build reads better than "Trader Joe's Cage Free Large Eggs." Use shopping-ready specificity in `ingredients[].name` when it matters.
- **Full frozen entrée overload** — If 3+ dinners are a fully frozen ready-to-eat bag, the week feels like meal prep for someone who doesn't cook. Cap at 4 per week, at most 3 of them dinners. Balance with real proteins that get cooked.
- **Forgetting small cooking steps** — "salmon fillet, pan-seared" is more satisfying than "frozen salmon, microwaved." Even a 5-minute sear changes the meal's character. Use prep notes that imply real cooking when the meal calls for it.
- **Every meal feeling like a product demo** — The meal plan is for a person, not a TJ's marketing deck. If reading the build feels like scrolling a product catalogue, rewrite it in food language.
- **Double-base on frozen complete entrées** — Butter Chicken with Basmati already includes rice. Adding a grain base separately double-counts the starch and breaks the macros.
- **Inventing TJ's products** — "Trader Joe's Chipotle Lime Crema" may not exist. Verify everything uncertain with a web search.
- **Ignoring the household's preferences** — Read `data/diner-preferences.md` every session: shellfish allergy (Dad's serving never contains it), mild shared meals, separable bell peppers, 450–550 kcal adult servings, each engine/base in at most 2 meals per week.
- **Repeating the same engine across the week** — Each engine and each base in at most 2 meals.
- **Vague ingredient quantities** — meal ingredients should have useful per-meal amounts like "6 oz" or "1 cup".
- **Publishing without validating macros** — Sum every day manually before publishing.
- **Serving the same meal two weeks in a row** — Always check `last_served_at`.
- **Ignoring negative feedback** — Disliked meals are retired until cleared.
- **Ignoring the companion junk rules** — Follow `data/companion-preferences.md` in full (flyer-first, dislikes, category counts, product pools).

## 📊 Style Reference

Use this table when calibrating meal build language:

| Dimension | Target style | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Basic protein naming | "salmon fillet, pan-seared" / "ground turkey, browned" / "chicken breasts, sliced" | "Trader Joe's Frozen Grilled Chicken Strips" for everything |
| Produce naming | "zucchini, sautéed" / "baby spinach" / "avocado" | "Trader Joe's Organic Baby Spinach" in the build card |
| Engine naming | Always full TJ's brand: "Trader Joe's Chili Onion Crunch" | "chili oil" / "hot sauce" / any generic |
| Specialty item naming | Always full TJ's brand: "Trader Joe's Cauliflower Gnocchi" / "Trader Joe's Norwegian Crispbread" | Generic substitutes that lose the TJ's-specific item |
| Build feel | 10–20 min real cooking implied | Pure microwave assembly every day |
| Frozen items | Grains + veg freely; full or packaged entrées ≤4/week (≤3 dinners) | Full entrées as the default protein across most of the week |
| Meal names | "Crunchy Salmon Bowl" / "Zhoug Herb Chicken" | "Butter Chicken with Basmati" (just the product name) |
